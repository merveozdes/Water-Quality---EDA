# INTRODUCTION
 Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. 
 This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level.
 In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions
 in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
